Here’s a **clearer, more engaging, and visually structured** version of your README, keeping all your original instructions but making them easier to follow and more appealing.

```markdown
# 🏥 Medical Chatbot – FAISS-based Question Answering  

An **AI-powered Medical Chatbot** that uses **FAISS** for fast similarity search and **semantic search** over custom medical data.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks for embedding generation and a **FastAPI** backend to serve responses in real-time.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/khuramshahz/medical-chatbot_FAISS.git
cd medical-chatbot_FAISS
````

---

### 2️⃣ Install Required Packages

**Create & activate a virtual environment** (optional, but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate        # On macOS/Linux
env\Scripts\activate           # On Windows
```

**Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Set up Git LFS (if not already installed)**:

```bash
git lfs install
```

---

### 3️⃣ Generate Embeddings & FAISS Index

Open the notebook and run all cells:

```bash
cd embeddings
# Open in Jupyter or Colab
```

* This will generate:

  * `index.faiss` – FAISS vector index
  * `qa_answers.json` – Matching answers file

---

### 4️⃣ Move Files to `model/` Folder

After generating, move them to the backend's model directory:

```bash
cp index.faiss ../app/model/
cp qa_answers.json ../app/model/
```

Or manually copy them from the notebook output into:

```
medical-chatbot_FAISS/app/model/
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Chatbot Backend

From the `app/` folder:

```bash
cd ../app
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### 6️⃣ Test the API

* Visit: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
* Swagger UI docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

---

## 💡 Notes

* **Git LFS** is used for large files like `index.faiss`.
* You can extend this chatbot with:

  * 🖥 A web frontend
  * 🎙 Voice interface
  * 🧠 More advanced NLP models

This version improves:  
- **Step-by-step clarity** with numbered headings.  
- **Better formatting** for commands and code blocks.  
- **Highlighting key files and outputs** in context.  
- **Quick testing instructions** for Swagger UI.  

If you want, I can make an **animated workflow diagram** showing:  
*"User question → Embedding search in FAISS → Answer retrieval → API response"*.  
That would make this README much more engaging.
